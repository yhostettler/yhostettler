## Hi there 👋, and WELCOME!



I'm **Yannic Hostettler**, a Robotics, Systems and Control MSc student at ETH Zurich, working on autonomous underwater robots for coral reef restoration.

I combine control and state estimation with hands-on prototyping, testing and system integration. I am motivated to use robotics to solve real-world problems in challenging environments and I am currently looking for an internship where I can contribute to impactful projects.
